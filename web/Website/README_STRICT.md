# Halloween Sessions (Strict, Two-Page)
- Filenames MUST match: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_SESSIONID_kind.ext`
  - SESSIONID: letters/digits/_-
  - kind: for photos use `photo` (e.g., `_photo.jpg`), videos can be `_booth.mp4` etc.
- Save files to:
  - media/photos/  (jpg, jpeg, png, webp, gif)
  - media/videos/  (mp4, mov, webm, mkv)
- Home (index.php): shows one representative photo and session ID per session.
- Session (session.php): shows all photos + video for that session, with View (lightbox/stream) and Download.

Tip: Write files as `.tmp_...` then rename when complete to avoid half-written entries.
