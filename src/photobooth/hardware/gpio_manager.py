"""
GPIOManager - Hardware Abstraction for GPIO Operations

RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Abstracts GPIO access for both Raspberry Pi hardware and development environments
- Manages button input detection with debouncing and callback registration
- Controls relay/prop trigger output for scare effects
- Provides unified interface regardless of underlying GPIO implementation

KEY METHODS:
- add_event_detect(): Register callback for button press events with debouncing
- trigger_scare(): Activate relay/prop for scare effect (active-low, 0.3s duration)
- cleanup(): Clean shutdown of GPIO resources

HARDWARE ABSTRACTION:
- Real Hardware: Uses RPi.GPIO for actual Raspberry Pi deployment
- Development: Uses fake_gpio module for testing without hardware
- Automatic fallback ensures code works in both environments

GPIO CONFIGURATION:
- Button: Input with pull-up resistor, falling edge detection
- Relay: Output for controlling external scare props (active-low)
- BCM pin numbering mode for consistency

ARCHITECTURE:
- Hardware abstraction following Dependency Inversion principle
- Encapsulates GPIO complexity from higher-level managers
- Clean separation between hardware interface and business logic
